# Manim Examples

This repository contains examples of Manim scenes for animating mathematical concepts.

## Introduction

Manim is a powerful animation engine for explanatory math videos. It allows you to create high-quality animations of mathematical concepts using Python code. This repository contains examples of Manim scenes that demonstrate how to animate various mathematical concepts. The scenes are organized into different folders based on the topic they cover.

## Usage

To use the scenes in this repository, you need to have Manim installed on your computer. You can install Manim by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html).

Once you have Manim installed, you can run any of the examples in this repository by navigating to the appropriate folder and running the corresponding Python script. For example, to run the **ODEScene** example, you can navigate to the ODEScene folder and run the **ode_scene.py** script.

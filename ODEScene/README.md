# Manim ODE Example

This repository contains a Manim example for animating the derivation of the solution to a first-order ordinary differential equation using the method of integrating factors. 

## Installation

To run this example, you need to install Manim. You can install Manim using pip:

```
pip install manim
```

## Usage

To run the animation, navigate to the `ode_scene` folder and execute the following command in the terminal:

```
manim ode_scene.py ODEScene -pl
```


This will generate a video of the animation in the `media/videos` folder. The `-pl` flag ensures that the animation is played immediately after rendering.

## Credits

This example is based on the tutorial on solving first-order ODEs.
